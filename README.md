What Are the Required Coding Skills for Data Science?
Although required programming skills will depend on the employer and the position, the most in-demand data science coding skills are Python and R. Structured Query Language (SQL) is also extremely popular for working with databases.11

Python
A free, open-source tool, Python is a programming language preferred by coding newcomers due to its readability and easy-to-understand syntax. It supports many libraries of pre-written code and web frameworks, in addition to many different industries, and it includes tools that support AI and ML.

R
Another of the open-source data science programming languages, R is optimized for data visualization and statistical analysis. It features complex data models and sophisticated tools for data reporting. A favorite among data scientists, R offers a wide range of tools and libraries to cleanse and prepare data, create visualizations, and train and evaluate ML and deep learning algorithms. The RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) can be used to simplify visualization, reporting and statistical analysis.14

SQL
Among the data science programming languages, SQL is used to query and manage relational databases, and data scientists use it to explore and visualize data sets. Easy to understand and use, itâ€™s an invaluable tool for data science applications. SQL enables data scientists to manage and store Big Data and, most importantly, to extract meaning from all that data. It integrates with essential data science programming languages such as Python and R.
